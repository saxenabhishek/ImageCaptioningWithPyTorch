# ImageCaptioningWithPyTorch
Caption Images using PyTorch <br />
##Motivation <br />
Image captioning is a leading method used by browsers to categorize images to provide us with relevant images according to our phrases entered, it can be very usefull as an aid to blind people when paired with a text to speech module and can be very benefitial with the new upcomign automated vehicle industries by providing a rather detailed account for long journeys. <br />
##Architecture <br />
####Autoencoder <br />
An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction, by training the network to ignore signal “noise”.<br />
####DenseNet <br />
DenseNet is a joint venture of researchers at Cornell University and Facebook, which took inspiration from Microsoft’s ResNet. The principal purpose of DenseNet was to build on the concept of ResNet, referring to previous layer for feature map influence, the only difference being instead of just taking feature map from one layer it concatenated feature maps from multiple layers following a general rule.<br />
##Next steps <br />
Using a better and bigger dataset and also train on more computational prowess to get good results.<br />
